Arkanoid is Classic arcade game wich i always want to replicate
It's very simple but outstanding gameplay drives you to play it again and again
So about project:
It's build in simple way:
5 Classes of game items: Ball - represent game ball in game
                         Brick - it's just a brick (if you lucky you can find awesome powerUp if you broke it)
                         Paddle - player's paddle to ricochet Ball in to Bricks (and broke them)
                         PowerUP - Awesome!!
                         Bullet - if you catch weapon PowerUP you cat shoot all brick alone
all of them extends Sprite class with some extensions;
MusicPlayer - to play background music.
LevelGenerator - Build levels form simple text file that represent brick place on the field by couple parameters (Brick
type,color) separated by semicolon;
GameField - game backend (engine) all game changes is calculated by this Class;
GamePane - it's "Face" of game. Game loop plus graphics
SoundEffectManager - this Class play all sound effect in game;
...and of course MainFrame Class - main Class of Project;

The Big problem of this project was to handle powerUP effects.
I divide them by Classes some to Ball effects some to Paddle effects;


P.S.: Yes, that's horrible powerUP images fully drown by me(sorry);
